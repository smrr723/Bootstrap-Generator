JS Bootstrap Grid Generator

About
A simple JS tool which allows you to input specific data into an array format
which will in turn display all array items in a grid.

This was just a quick and easy solution to a small task I was given at work, so may
be useful to someone else.  There are obvious limitations to the program but I may
improve it when I get a chance.
